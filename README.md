# Swift-Walk-Tracker
An open source walk tracking iOS App written in Swift

## About
The walk tracking application was intended to be incredibly simplistic.  While visiting Seville we wanted to track all our walks around the various amazing streets. This project was created to help learn a full application in Swift while also accomplishing a simple walking tracker.

## Features
There are really only two major features, track current walks using the GPS and review previous walks. This project was intended to be a small scope of features done really well.

## Want to help?
I am definitely interested in seeing what other people would be interested in adding. Send over any questions or pull requests! I would also love to work with an app designer to create an icon and loading screen.
